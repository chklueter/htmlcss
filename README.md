## Homework Week 1

Just an example of what your first repository should look like!

####Some extra tips

If you want to learn how to write nice looking README's then you should look in **Markdown** language which you can read more about [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

It's a really helpful and easy way to make pleasant looking README's. 

####What are README's actually good for?

They are usually the first thing a visitor to your repository sees and they can explain:

- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project
- Who maintains and contributes to the project
